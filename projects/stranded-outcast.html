      <h2>Premise</h2>
      <p>
      Your plane crashes onto a small uninhabited island. With no people to 
      communicate with and no nearby civilization to fall back on, you are 
      an Outcast. Soon, you discover the reason the island is abandoned and 
      uninhabited: at night, animals that seem to appear out of nowhere 
      deviate from their docile and minimally territorial ways to hunt you 
      down. You, the Outcast, have only one option. The East shore of the 
      island has a small dock with a boat in need of repair, perhaps left 
      from the previous inhabitants of the island. Your goal is now to 
      survive on this haunted island, collecting enough resources to repair 
      the boat and escape!
