               I am a software developer who graduated from Cal Poly SLO with both 
               a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science. In my free time, 
               I enjoy playing board games with friends, developing games, and writing 
               stories and poems. Back in Cal Poly, I was president of the Chinese 
               Cultural Club and helped found the Dragonboat Club.

               I value trying and learning new things -- from cooking, art, music to
               new programming languages.

      <p>
         As external depedendencies have been known to introduce vulnerabilities 
         to popular projects, my thesis aimed to help developers analyze their
         dependencies and choose between dependencies by providing an interactive
         software visualization tool called DependencyVis. This tool provides
         developers the ability to make informed decisions about dependencies
         without spending too much time researching. More about my thesis can be
         found <a href="">here</a>.
